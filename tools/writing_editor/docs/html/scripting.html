<center><h2>Scripting</h2></center>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>PARPG writing will use a custom scripting language that resembles BASIC in it's syntax. All of the functions will be explained here. If you are stuck on something, a good place to look would be the example. Instructions for further help can be found on the home page.</p>
<h3>General Help</h3>
<p>You can declare and set variables just like most languages: variable = value.</p>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>The functions will be listed here in all uppercase. However, when you use a function, it can be either <b>all</b> uppercase or <b>all</b> lowercase. For example, say is valid, SAY is valid, but Say or sAy is not valid.</p>
